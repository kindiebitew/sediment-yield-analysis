# Sediment Yield Analysis for Gilgel Abay and Gumara Watersheds

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing sediment yields in the Gilgel Abay and Gumara watersheds, as described in the manuscript submitted to *Journal of Hydrology* (Bitew, 2025).

## Repository Structure
- `code/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
  - `model_performance.py`: Evaluates performance of SRC, GB, RF, and QRF models.
  - `feature_importance.py`: Computes QRF feature importance.
  - `annual_sediment_yield.py`: Estimates annual sediment yields.
  - `monthly_sediment_yield.py`: Estimates monthly sediment yields.
  - `seasonal_sediment_yield.py`: Estimates seasonal (wet/dry) sediment yields.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the repository.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r code/requirements.txt`
2. Run scripts in a Python environment (e.g., Conda with `pykrige`).
   - Note: Input data (e.g., `Intermittent_data.xlsx`, `continuous_data.csv`) are not provided in this repository.
   - Outputs (e.g., CSVs, plots) are not included but can be generated by running the scripts with appropriate data.

## Data and Images
Input data and output images are not included in this release to respect ongoing review processes. They are available upon request from the author or will be included in a future Zenodo release.

## License
This repository is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`).
